## 🎯 Learning Goal

Master n8n automation platform and become proficient in creating workflows for diverse scenarios using various node types.

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

This learning plan is built on four pedagogical principles:

- **Scaffolding** - Progressive complexity from simple to advanced
- **Constructive Alignment** - Clear alignment between objectives, activities, and assessments
- **Learn and Practice** - Immediate hands-on application of concepts
- **Multiple Means of Presentation** - Visual workflows, code examples, templates, and documentation

## 🗺️ Learning Path

```
Foundation (Weeks 1-2) → Core Skills (Weeks 3-5) → Intermediate (Weeks 6-8) 
    → Advanced (Weeks 9-11) → Mastery Projects (Week 12+)
```

## 📊 Quick Stats

- **Total Nodes to Master**: 535
- **Trigger Nodes**: 108
- **AI-Capable Nodes**: 269
- **Available Templates**: 2,646
- **Estimated Duration**: 12+ weeks
- **Time Commitment**: 5-10 hours/week

## 📅 Current Phase: Foundation

### Week 1: Core Concepts & First Workflows
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

**Learning Objectives**:
- [ ] Understand n8n architecture and workflow execution model
- [ ] Master the 5 node categories: trigger, input, transform, output, AI
- [ ] Use data structures: `$json`, `$node`, expressions
- [ ] Differentiate between Manual Trigger and automated triggers

**Exercises**:
- [ ] 1.1: Hello World Workflow
- [ ] 1.2: HTTP Request Workflow
- [ ] 1.3: Data Transformation
- [ ] Assessment: Public API Integration

## 🎓 Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Master basic concepts, create simple workflows, understand triggers.

### Phase 2: Core Skills (Weeks 3-5)
Data transformation, conditional logic, service integrations, debugging.

### Phase 3: Intermediate Applications (Weeks 6-8)
Loops, batch processing, databases, API development.

### Phase 4: Advanced Patterns (Weeks 9-11)
AI integration, workflow composition, production best practices.

### Phase 5: Mastery Projects (Week 12+)
Real-world production-grade automation systems.
