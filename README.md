## 📅 Current Phase: Foundation

### Week 1: Core Concepts & First Workflows
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

**Learning Objectives**:
- [ ] Understand n8n architecture and workflow execution model
- [ ] Master the 5 node categories: trigger, input, transform, output, AI
- [ ] Use data structures: `$json`, `$node`, expressions
- [ ] Differentiate between Manual Trigger and automated triggers

**Exercises**:
- [ ] 1.1: Hello World Workflow ([Issue #1](https://github.com/dandange8005/n8n-mastery-learning/issues/1))
- [ ] 1.2: HTTP Request Workflow
- [ ] 1.3: Data Transformation
- [ ] Assessment: Public API Integration
