4. Schedule your study time for the week

**How to:**
```bash
# 1. Navigate to Issues tab on GitHub
# 2. Click "New Issue"
# 3. Select "Exercise Completion" template
# 4. Create one issue for each exercise (1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
# 5. Add labels: week-X, exercise, phase-X
```

**Example Issues to Create:**
- `[WEEK 1] Exercise 1.1: Hello World Workflow`
- `[WEEK 1] Exercise 1.2: HTTP Request Workflow`
- `[WEEK 1] Exercise 1.3: Data Transformation`
- `[WEEK 1] Assessment: Public API Integration`

### Tuesday - Thursday: Exercise Days (60 min each)

**Daily Study Flow:**

#### Step 1: Start Your Study Session (5 min)
- [ ] Open your GitHub issue for today's exercise
- [ ] Read the learning objectives
- [ ] Open n8n interface
- [ ] Open your notes file

#### Step 2: Learn with MCP Tools (10 min)
Use these commands with Claude to discover nodes:

```
# Find the nodes you need
search_nodes({query: 'keyword'})

# Get configuration details
get_node_essentials('nodes-base.nodeName')

# Get comprehensive docs
get_node_documentation('nodes-base.nodeName')

# Validate before building
validate_node_minimal('nodes-base.nodeName', {})
```

**Example Learning Session:**
```
You: "I need to build a workflow with a manual trigger and set node"

Claude with MCP:
search_nodes({query: 'manual trigger'})
get_node_essentials('nodes-base.manualTrigger')
get_node_essentials('nodes-base.set')
```

**Validation Process:**
```
# Before saving, validate your workflow
validate_workflow(workflowJson)
validate_workflow_connections(workflowJson)
validate_workflow_expressions(workflowJson)
```

#### Step 4: Save and Document (10 min)
- [ ] Export workflow from n8n
- [ ] Save as `X.Y-exercise-name.json` in correct directory
- [ ] Take notes in `Phase-X/Week-Y/notes.md`
- [ ] Update checklist in GitHub issue

**File Structure:**
```

  Week-1/
    workflows/
      1.1-hello-world.json        ‚Üê Save here
      1.2-http-request.json
      1.3-data-transform.json
    notes.md                       ‚Üê Take notes here
```

#### Step 5: Commit to GitHub (5 min)
```bash
# Clone repo if you haven't already
git clone https://github.com/dandange8005/n8n-mastery-learning.git
cd n8n-mastery-learning

# Add your workflow and notes
git add Phase-1-Foundation/Week-1/workflows/1.1-hello-world.json
git add Phase-1-Foundation/Week-1/notes.md

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Complete Exercise 1.1: Hello World Workflow

- Built manual trigger ‚Üí set node workflow
- Learned basic data transformation
- Documented key learnings in notes.md"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## üéØ Using MCP Tools for Learning

### Discovery Phase

**Finding the Right Nodes:**
```
# Start broad
search_nodes({query: 'http'})

# Browse by category  
list_nodes({category: 'trigger', limit: 20})

# Find AI capabilities
list_ai_tools()
```

### Configuration Phase

**Understanding Node Setup:**
```
# Quick reference (10-20 properties)
get_node_essentials('nodes-base.slack')

# Full documentation
get_node_documentation('nodes-base.slack')

# Find specific properties
search_node_properties('nodes-base.httpRequest', 'authentication')

# See property dependencies
get_property_dependencies('nodes-base.httpRequest')
```

### Validation Phase

**Before Building:**
```
# Check required fields
validate_node_minimal('nodes-base.slack', {
  resource: 'message',
  operation: 'send'
})

# Full validation
validate_node_operation('nodes-base.slack', fullConfig, 'runtime')
```

**After Building:**
```
# Validate complete workflow
validate_workflow(workflowJson)

# Check structure
validate_workflow_connections(workflowJson)

# Check expressions
validate_workflow_expressions(workflowJson)
```

### Learning from Templates

**Finding Examples:**
```
# Search templates
search_templates({query: 'slack notification', limit: 10})

# Get template details
get_template({templateId: 1234, mode: 'full'})

# Find templates using specific nodes
list_node_templates({nodeTypes: ['n8n-nodes-base.slack']})
```

## üéì Study Tips

### Time Management

**Recommended Weekly Schedule:**
- Monday: 30 min (planning)
- Tue-Thu: 60 min each (exercises)
- Friday: 90 min (assessment + review)
- Weekend: 30 min (reflection + planning)
- **Total**: 5-6 hours/week

### Learning Strategies

**Active Learning:**
- Don't just follow tutorials - experiment!
- Break things intentionally to learn
- Build variations of exercises
- Teach concepts back to yourself

**Spaced Repetition:**
- Review previous workflows weekly
- Rebuild key workflows from memory
- Create your own exercises

**Deliberate Practice:**
- Focus on weaknesses
- Push slightly beyond comfort zone
- Get feedback (from validation tools)
- Reflect on performance

### When You're Stuck

1. **Check Your Resources:**
   - Review `resources/cheat-sheets/expressions.md`
   - Check `resources/references/useful-links.md`
   - Look at previous workflows

2. **Use MCP Tools:**
   - Search for examples: `search_templates({query: 'your problem'})`
   - Get node help: `get_node_documentation('nodes-base.nodeName')`
   - Find similar solutions: `list_node_templates({nodeTypes: [...]})`

3. **Take a Break:**
   - Step away for 15 minutes
   - Come back with fresh eyes
   - Try a different approach

4. **Ask for Help:**
   - Create GitHub issue with "help-wanted" label
   - Post in n8n community forum
   - Document your question clearly
